# Back End Module Project

## Situation

For the backend module, I created a **Personal Finance Management App**. The purpose of this app was to allow users to:

- Sign up and create an account.
- Open an account and perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals.
- Generate a report to view account information and all related transactions in an easy-to-read format.

## Task

As this was a backend-only project, my tasks included:

- **Creating models**: Developed multiple models to represent entities such as accounts, transactions, and users.
- **Implementing CRUD operations**: Developed methods to create, read, update, and delete records for each model.
- **Building API endpoints**: Created API endpoints to interact with the database and call these methods, enabling users to:
  - Perform various actions on their accounts.
  - View personalized account and transaction details.
