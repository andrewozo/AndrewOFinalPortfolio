# Inventory App Project

## Situation

The First projects that I worked on with a group during the apprenticeship was the <strong>Inventory App</strong>. The Inventory App is Fullstack application created to be able to track and display current inventory.

## Task

This was the first project that we worked on for the aprrenticeship, and it had to be a Fullstack application with the main focus of being a CRUD application where as the user you can be do multiple things like:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Viewing All Items in the Inventory</strong></li>
    <li><strong>View Individual Inventory Items</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Add an Item to Inventory</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Update an Inventory Item</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Delete an Item from the inventory</strong></li>
</ul>

## Action

During the project I worked on and implemented things like:

<p> --<strong>Backend Routes For Item</strong>Snippet of the CRUD Routes for the Item model in the Backend </p>
<img src="../Inventory/ImagesIP/BackendRouteItems.png" alt="Backend Routes" />

<p> --<strong>React Component for the Add Items Form</strong>This is the React Component that would allow the user to add items to the inventory</p>
